It is an Android client for Ruby China. For more information about the community itself, please visit http://ruby-china.org/.
This project requires GreenDroid as library to support it's UI presentation, you can fork it from my github https://github.com/longerian/GreenDroid
or the origin one which is https://github.com/cyrilmottier/GreenDroid. These two are almost the same at current time, but I may do little modification
in the future.
